                                     OVERVIEW SECTION
     ========================================================================================= -->
## Overview

Software Engineering (CSC601) and SE Lab (CSL601) are core subjects in the Third Year (Semester VI) of the Computer Engineering curriculum at the University of Mumbai. These courses provide foundational knowledge of software development methodologies, project management, requirement analysis, design patterns, and testing strategies.

### Course Topics

The curriculum encompasses several key domains in Software Engineering:

- **Introduction to Software Engineering**: Software process, lifecycle models (Waterfall, Spiral, Agile).
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**: SRS documentation, data modeling, functional modeling.
- **Project Scheduling and Tracking**: Effort estimation, COCOMO, project planning techniques.
- **Software Design**: Architectural design, component-level design, UI design principles.
- **Risk Analysis, SCM & SQA**: Risk management, software configuration management, quality assurance.
- **Software Testing**: Unit testing, integration testing, system testing, black-box and white-box techniques.

### Repository Purpose

This repository represents a curated collection of study materials, reference books, lab experiments, and personal preparation notes compiled during my academic journey. The primary motivation for creating and maintaining this archive is simple yet profound: **to preserve knowledge for continuous learning and future reference**.

As a computer engineer, understanding software development principles is crucial for building reliable, maintainable, and scalable systems. This repository serves as my intellectual reference point: a resource I can return to for relearning concepts, reviewing methodologies, and strengthening understanding when needed.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to comprehensive study materials beyond the classroom.
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of fundamental software engineering concepts.
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my learning journey through SE and SE Lab.
- **Community Contribution**: To share these resources with students and learners who may benefit from them.

All materials in this repository were gathered, organized, and documented by me during my undergraduate studies (2018-2022) as part of my coursework and exam preparation.

### Project Overview
A responsive Digital Bookstore website developed as a mini project for the Software Engineering Lab. The website lists all of the books that are currently available in the shop, along with their descriptions. Users can browse books by category or author, search for a specific book, and view complete description pages. The platform features sorting by price or discount, user registration and login, shopping cart functionality, and direct email support for inquiries. This project showcases the practical integration of **PHP**, **MySQL**, and **front-end technologies** to solve real-world e-commerce challenges.

> [!NOTE]
> **Research Impact**: This project was published as a research paper in **International Journal for Research in Applied Science and Engineering Technology (IJRASET)** (Volume 9, Issue 7) and is also available as a preprint on **viXra**.

### Acknowledgments

Grateful acknowledgment to [Mega Satish](https://github.com/msatmod) for her exceptional support and collaboration during the laboratory experiments of this course. Her constant support, patience, and clarity as we learned the fundamentals of Software Engineering together made a real difference. Working alongside her was truly enriching—her ability to simplify complex concepts and her steady encouragement turned challenging experiments into meaningful learning moments. This repository reflects the growth that came from our shared curiosity and mutual dedication to mastering the subject. Thank you, Mega, for being such an outstanding partner to learn with and for all the knowledge we shared along the way.

Special thanks to the faculty members of the Department of Computer Engineering at Terna Engineering College for their guidance and instruction in Software Engineering. Their clear teaching and continued support helped develop a strong understanding of software development principles.

Special thanks to the mentors and peers whose encouragement, discussions, and support contributed meaningfully to this learning experience.
